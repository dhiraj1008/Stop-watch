> This is a simple stopwatch program written in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows you to start, stop, and reset the timer using buttons.

#### Run the program:
Bash
java StopWatch

### How it Works
The program uses Swing components to create a window with a label and three buttons. Clicking the buttons triggers actions:

* Start: Starts the timer and disables the start button while enabling the stop button. (Optional: You can implement a timer thread for continuous time updates)
* Stop: Stops the timer, updates the label with the elapsed time, and enables the start button while disabling the stop button. (Optional: You can implement logic to stop a timer thread)
* Reset: Resets the timer to zero, updates the label, and enables the start button.
Customization
###### This is a basic implementation. You can extend it with features like:

* Timer thread for continuous time updates on the label
* Lap functionality to record split times
* Ability to change the time format
